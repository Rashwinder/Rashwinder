Diatastic - Master of Data Science Capstone Unit.
<br/>
<br/>

*Diatastic was created to assist diabetics in managing their diabetes by unifying the various tools that were currently available. The backend was built in Django, and the data used is stored in an SQL database. The flow of information starts with the user entering the individual items that they consumed, as well as their blood sugar level. A recommended insulin dose is then provided. Diatastic also provides the user with visualisations of their blood sugar level, carbohydrate intake and insulin usage over time. In addition, the visualisations can be sent to an email of the user's choice.*
